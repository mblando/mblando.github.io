	<h2>My Dog Cheddar</h2>
	
		<p> Hi Everyone! My name is Cheddar. I am a one year old male golden retreiver. My mom rescued me when I was just six months old, and now we are the best of friends. <p>
		<p> Some of my favorite hobbies are playing fetch, going on runs with my mom, eating bully sticks, and going for car rides! I also love going to Starbucks and getting pup cups.
